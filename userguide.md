# The Talking Throne: A User Guide

## How does it work?

* There is an __RFID antenna__ in the backrest of the throne. You can see this if you have a look around the back - it's the flat box whose edges you can make out under the upholstery.
* This antenna reads the __tags__ on the word plates as someone walks the red carpet. The tags are the white labels on the back of the plates.
* There are __sensors__ on the __first step__ and __seat__ which detect someone __treading on the step__ and __sitting down__, respectively. 
  * the sensor on the __first step__ __freezes__ the RFID reader - whatever words are in front of the throne at that point will be announced.
  * the sensor in the __seat__ triggers an announcement.

⚠️ Humans and their troublesome watery flesh __block the RFID reader's radio signal__. If someone is standing (or sitting) between the word plates and the back of the throne as someone else walks the carpet, the tags will __probably not read__. This also means that if someone's got their hand over the tags, it'll also fail to read.

⚠️ The antenna needs a __clear line of sight__ to the word plates as someone walks the red carpet. A way to frame this for the audience is that _'the throne needs to see your words as you walk up to it'_. Sometimes this means that particularly small people need to hold the board up a bit.

⚠️ The tags need to be __parallel__ to the antenna (e.g __facing the back of the throne__) in order to read properly. This can also be explained to the audience as **the throne needing to get a good look at the words**.

⚠️ The tag labels have __RFID chips__ in the middle - they're the little nubbins that stand proud of the rest of the label. Over time, the label over these chips can get __worn away__. If this happens, the chip can get __sheared off__, causing the label to __become useless__. This is why we put stickers on the nubbins - to protect the chips as the labels wear. You can check for a sheared chip by tilting the label back and forth under the light - if there's no nubbin, and a __silvery patch__ where one should be, it's sheared off and the tag is dead.

⚠️ While no-one is sitting in the throne, it's __scanning for tags__ in a radius of __just under two metres__ around the __RFID antenna__. As someone walks the red carpet, the tags are scanned, and whatever the scanner's picked up is __locked in__ when the __sensor on the bottom step__ is trodden on. This means that:
 * if __any other tags__, besides those in the board being held by the current sitter, are __inside the two-meter radius__ at the time the step sensor is trodden on, they will confuse the reader,
 * if the __step sensor__ is not trodden on, the reader may not freeze correctly, causing an unpredictable read of the tags.

## The ideal sequence of a sitting
* Someone picks their title and assembles a board from a __noun__, __adjective__ and __place__.
* That someone __walks the red carpet__, holding their board up __nice and straight__, in __clear view__ of the throne's backrest.
* They __continue to hold up their board__ as their __foot hits the bottom step__ of the dias.
* They __sit down nice and heavily__ on the seat sensor, squishing the black flat plastic pad and __triggering an announcement__.
* Dramatic announcement rings out around the room. All words have been correctly read. Delight, rejoicing, and applause.
